As the freelance lead developer & project manager, I:

- Scaled the project from an internal PoC to a reliable platform used by hundreds of students, healthcare
  professionals & partner cities across France.
- Translated the founder's vision into actual features, helping him prioritize the roadmap to scale quickly while
  mitigating the technical debt from the PoC.
- Managed several developers to work with me on the platform development.
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
