As the solo developer, I designed & developed the entire application, including:

- The responsive frontend using React, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- The backend using FastAPI, PostgreSQL and Alembic.
- The smart contracts & blockchain interactions using Solidity.
- The deployment using Docker and GitHub Actions.

I also had the opportunity to [demo the project live on stage](https://www.youtube.com/live/if_XZf0IIr8?t=5864s) in
front of the 500+ other hackers at the end of the event.
